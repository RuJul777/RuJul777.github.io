                    Calendula (/kəˈlɛndjuːlə/)[2] is a genus of about 15–20 
                    species[3] of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in 
                    the daisy family, Asteraceae that are often known as 
                    marigolds.[4]: 771  They are native to southwestern 
                    Asia, western Europe, Macaronesia, and the 
                    Mediterranean. Other plants known as marigolds include 
                    corn marigold, desert marigold, marsh marigold, 
                    and plants of the genus Tagetes.

                    The genus name Calendula is a modern Latin diminutive 
                    of calendae, meaning "little calendar", "little clock" 
                    or possibly "little weather-glass".[5] The common name 
                    "marigold", a contraction of "Mary's gold"[5] 
                    refers to the Virgin Mary. The most commonly 
                    cultivated and used member of the genus is 
                    Calendula officinalis, the pot marigold. 
                    Popular herbal and cosmetic products named 
                    "Calendula" invariably derive from C. officinalis.

                <p>
                    Calendula was not a major medicinal herb but it was 
                    used in historic times for headaches, red eye, fever 
                    and toothaches. As late as the 17th century Nicholas 
                    Culpeper claimed Calendula benefited the heart, but it 
                    was not considered an especially efficacious medicine.[
                    6]
                    <span id="span-1"></span>
                    In historic times Calendula was more often used for 
                    magical purposes than medicinal ones. One 16th-century 
                    potion containing Calendula claimed to reveal fairies. 
                    An unmarried woman with two suitors would take a blend 
                    of powdered Calendula, marjoram, wormwood and thyme 
                    simmered in honey and white wine used as an ointment 
                    in a ritual to reveal her true match.[6]
                    <span id="span-1"></span>
                    Ancient Romans and Greeks used the golden Calendula in 
                    many rituals and ceremonies, sometimes wearing crowns 
                    or garlands made from the flowers. One of its nicknames 
                    is "Mary's Gold", referring to the flowers' use in 
                    early Christian events in some countries. Calendula 
                    flowers are sacred flowers in India and have been 
                    used to decorate the statues of Hindu deities since 
                    early times.[7]
                    <span id="span-1"></span>
                    The most common use in historic times was culinary, 
                    however, and the plant was used for both its color 
                    and its flavor. They were used for dumplings, wine, 
                    oatmeal and puddings. In English cuisine Calendula 
                    were often cooked in the same pot with spinach, or 
                    used to flavor stewed birds. According to 
                    sixteenth-century Englishman John Gerard, every proper 
                    soup of Dutch cuisine in his era would include 
                    Calendula petals.[6]

                    Also known as "poor man's saffron,"[8] the petals are 
                    edible and can be used fresh in salads or dried and 
                    used to color cheese or as a substitute for saffron.[9] 
                    Calendulas have a mildly sweet taste that is slightly 
                    bitter, and as it dries these flavors become more 
                    intense. [10] It can be used to add color to soups, 
                    stews, poultry dishes, custards and liquors.[6]

                    The common name for Calendula officinalis in Britain 
                    is 'pot-marigold,' named so because of its use in 
                    broths and soups.[11]

                    The flowers of C. officinalis contain flavonol 
                    glycosides, triterpene oligoglycosides, 
                    oleanane-type triterpene glycosides, 
                    saponins, and a sesquiterpene glucoside.[13][14]

                <p>
                    Calendula officinalis oil is still used medicinally as 
                    an anti-inflammatory and a remedy for healing wounds.
                    [15] Calendula ointments are skin products available 
                    for use on minor cuts, burns, and skin irritation;[16] 
                    though evidence of their effectiveness is weak.[16][17]
                    <span id="span-1"></span>
                    Plant pharmacological studies have suggested that 
                    Calendula extracts have antiviral, antigenotoxic, 
                    and anti-inflammatory properties in vitro.[18] In 
                    herbalism, Calendula in suspension or in tincture 
                    is used topically for treating acne, 
                    reducing inflammation, controlling bleeding, 
                    and soothing irritated tissue.[19][20] 
                    Limited evidence indicates Calendula cream 
                    or ointment is effective in treating radiation 
                    dermatitis.[21][22] Topical application of C. 
                    officinalis ointment has helped to prevent 
                    dermatitis and pain; thus reducing the incidence 
                    rate of skipped radiation treatments in randomized 
                    trials.[20]
                    <span id="span-1"></span>
                    Calendula has been used traditionally for abdominal 
                    cramps and constipation.[23] In experiments with 
                    rabbit jejunum, the aqueous-ethanol extract of C. 
                    officinalis flowers was shown to have both 
                    spasmolytic and spasmogenic effects, thus providing a 
                    scientific rationale for this traditional use.[23] An 
                    aqueous extract of C. officinalis obtained by a novel 
                    extraction method has demonstrated antitumor 
                    (cytotoxic) activity and immunomodulatory properties 
                    (lymphocyte activation) in vitro, as well as antitumor 
                    activity in mice.[18]

                    Calendula plants are known to cause allergic reactions 
                    in susceptible individuals,[24][25] 
                    and should be avoided during pregnancy.[24]
