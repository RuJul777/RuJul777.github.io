                        Calendula (/kəˈlɛndjuːlə/)[2] is a genus of about 15–20 
                        species[3] of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in 
                        the daisy family, Asteraceae that are often known as 
                        marigolds.[4]: 771  They are native to southwestern 
                        Asia, western Europe, Macaronesia, and the 
                        Mediterranean. Other plants known as marigolds include 
                        corn marigold, desert marigold, marsh marigold, 
                        and plants of the genus Tagetes.

                        The genus name Calendula is a modern Latin diminutive 
                        of calendae, meaning "little calendar", "little clock" 
                        or possibly "little weather-glass".[5] The common name 
                        "marigold", a contraction of "Mary's gold"[5] 
                        refers to the Virgin Mary. The most commonly 
                        cultivated and used member of the genus is 
                        Calendula officinalis, the pot marigold. 
                        Popular herbal and cosmetic products named 
                        "Calendula" invariably derive from C. officinalis.

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>
                        Calendula was not a major medicinal herb but it was 
                        used in historic times for headaches, red eye, fever 
                        and toothaches. As late as the 17th century Nicholas 
                        Culpeper claimed Calendula benefited the heart, but it 
                        was not considered an especially efficacious medicine.[
                        6]

                        In historic times Calendula was more often used for 
                        magical purposes than medicinal ones. One 16th-century 
                        potion containing Calendula claimed to reveal fairies. 
                        An unmarried woman with two suitors would take a blend 
                        of powdered Calendula, marjoram, wormwood and thyme 
                        simmered in honey and white wine used as an ointment 
                        in a ritual to reveal her true match.[6]

                        Ancient Romans and Greeks used the golden Calendula in 
                        many rituals and ceremonies, sometimes wearing crowns 
                        or garlands made from the flowers. One of its nicknames 
                        is "Mary's Gold", referring to the flowers' use in 
                        early Christian events in some countries. Calendula 
                        flowers are sacred flowers in India and have been 
                        used to decorate the statues of Hindu deities since 
                        early times.[7]

                        The most common use in historic times was culinary, 
                        however, and the plant was used for both its color 
                        and its flavor. They were used for dumplings, wine, 
                        oatmeal and puddings. In English cuisine Calendula 
                        were often cooked in the same pot with spinach, or 
                        used to flavor stewed birds. According to 
                        sixteenth-century Englishman John Gerard, every proper 
                        soup of Dutch cuisine in his era would include 
                        Calendula petals.[6]

                        Also known as "poor man's saffron,"[8] the petals are 
                        edible and can be used fresh in salads or dried and 
                        used to color cheese or as a substitute for saffron.[9] 
                        Calendulas have a mildly sweet taste that is slightly 
                        bitter, and as it dries these flavors become more 
                        intense. [10] It can be used to add color to soups, 
                        stews, poultry dishes, custards and liquors.[6]

                        The common name for Calendula officinalis in Britain 
                        is 'pot-marigold,' named so because of its use in 
                        broths and soups.[11]

                        The flowers of C. officinalis contain flavonol 
                        glycosides, triterpene oligoglycosides, 
                        oleanane-type triterpene glycosides, 
                        saponins, and a sesquiterpene glucoside.[13][14]
