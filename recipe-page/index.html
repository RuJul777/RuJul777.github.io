    <h2><a id="#recipe"></a>Ingredients And Preparation</h2>
    <br>

        To start, you’ll need a head of napa cabbage, which forms the base of your 
        kimchi. Begin by cutting the cabbage into quarters, removing the core, and 
        slicing it into smaller, bite-sized pieces. Rinse it really well to remove 
        any dirt or bugs that may have gotten into the cabbage. Then toss the 
        cabbage with a generous amount of coarse salt. Make sure to massage it into 
        every piece, cover it with water, place a heavy plate on top to press it 
        down, and let it sit for about 1-2 hours. This process helps to soften the 
        cabbage and draw out excess moisture, which is crucial for the right texture
        in your finished kimchi. After it’s softened, rinse the cabbage thoroughly 
        under cold water to remove the salt, and then drain it well.

        While your cabbage is softening, you can prepare the kimchi paste, which is
        where all the magic happens. Start by making a rice flour paste, combining
        sweet rice flour with water, and cooking it in a pot over medium heat 
        until it thickens. Allow this paste to cool, as it will be mixed with 
        other flavorful ingredients. For the kimchi paste itself, blend a quarter 
        to a third of a yellow onion with several garlic cloves and a small piece 
        of ginger until smooth.

        <br>

        Once your rice flour paste is cooled, mix it with the garlic, onion, and 
        ginger paste. To this mixture, add white sugar, fish sauce, and gochugaru 
        (Korean red pepper flakes) to taste. The amount of gochugaru will determine 
        how spicy your kimchi is, so adjust according to your preference. A bit of 
        salt is added for seasoning, rounding out the flavors. Now for the veggies
        — to your bowl with the prepared napa cabbage, add sliced green onions and 
        julienned Korean radish.

        Next, combine the kimchi paste with your veggies. Using your hands 
        (gloves are highly recommended to avoid staining your skin), massage the 
        paste into the cabbage until every piece is thoroughly coated. This step is
        crucial as it ensures that the flavors penetrate every part of the 
        cabbage.

        Transfer the mixture into a clean jar or airtight container, packing it 
        tightly to eliminate air pockets. Leave some space at the top of the jar
        to accommodate the kimchi’s expansion as it ferments. Seal the jar and 
        let it sit at room temperature for about 1-2 days. The fermentation time
            will vary depending on your room temperature and how tangy you like your
            kimchi. I like it only a bit tangy so I leave it out overnight and then
            pop it in the fridge. Once it’s fermented to your liking, move the jar
            to the refrigerator to slow down the fermentation process.
