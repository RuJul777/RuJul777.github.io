            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, softened</li>
                <li>Four ½-in. thick slices sourdough bread</li>
                <li>2⅓ cup (8 oz.) coarsely grated Comté cheese</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <b>T</b>he secret to making a perfect grilled cheese sandwich is cooking 
            it over low heat, which brings out the subtle flavors of a cheese. 
            Nutty and complex Comté, made in the Jura region of the French Alps,
            is great for grilling; if you can’t find it, Gruyère is a suitable 
            substitute. Slathering the bread liberally with butter helps the 
            bread crisp evenly in the pan.
            <br>
            <br>
            This recipe first ran alongside <i>Cara De Silva’s</i> 2009 article, 
            <b>“The Real Thing.”</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Spread the butter evenly on both sides of each slice of 
                    bread. Put half of the cheese on one slice and half on 
                    another. Top each with remaining bread slices.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Heat a large cast-iron skillet or griddle over medium-low 
                    heat. Add the sandwiches and cook, flipping once, until 
                    golden brown and crusty on both sides, 18–20 minutes. 
                    Transfer the sandwiches to a cutting board, cool slightly, 
                    then slice them in half and serve warm.

            <i>
                Grab a loaf of French bread, and get ready for the pizza hack of
                a lifetime. Instead of dealing with dough, use a loaf 
                to create the delicious base to your pizza. Not only
                will it get perfectly crisp in the oven, but it's so 
                easy to create—simply toast your bread, add your desired
                topping, bake and voila! Pizza night has never been easier.

            <b>What is French bread pizza?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Instead of dealing with pizza dough, we use a loaf of French bread to create 
            our pizza! The "crust" that forms will be crispy on the outside, while staying
            nice and soft on the inside. While it's delicious as is, we decided to take 
            things a step further. We brushed our French loaf with garlic butter here to 
            create a garlic bread-esque crust, adding one of our other favorite Italian 
            restaurant staples into the mix. 
            <br>
            <br>
            You could skip the garlic if you’re a purist (but hey, we’re 
            making pizza on bread here, so we say anything goes!), but we still
            recommend toasting the bread for a few minutes before you put your
            toppings on to keep it nice and crisp.
            <br>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 400°. Slice bread in half lengthwise. Mix
                    melted butter and garlic together and brush all over cut 
                    side of bread. Bake for 10 minutes to lightly toast. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spread marinara on top and top with mozzarella, pepperoni 
                    slices, parmesan, and red pepper flakes. Bake again until 
                    cheese is melty, 10 minutes more. 
                </li>
                <li>Top with basil to serve.</li>

            <br>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 350°. Grease a 13"-by-9" glass baking dish 
                    with oil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat.
                    Add pasta and 2 tablespoons salt and cook, stirring 
                    occasionally, until al dente, 7 to 9 minutes (pasta 
                    should still be slightly undercooked in the center).
                    Drain pasta; set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, heat 1 
                    tablespoon oil. Add sausage and cook, breaking into
                    bite-size pieces, until browned and cooked through,
                    4 to 5 minutes. Transfer sausage to a medium bowl, 
                    leaving as much fat in skillet as possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In same skillet over medium heat, combine mushrooms and 
                    1 tablespoon oil; season with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, 
                    tossing occasionally, until browned, 5 to 6 minutes.
                    Transfer mushrooms to bowl with sausage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In same skillet over medium heat, cook onion, garlic, 
                    1/2 teaspoon salt, and remaining 2 tablespoons oil, 
                    stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, 4 to 5 
                    minutes. Stir in tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, oregano, 
                    basil, red pepper flakes, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. 
                    Remove 2 cups sauce and reserve. Fold bell peppers and 
                    cooked sausage, mushrooms, and reserved pasta into 
                    remaining sauce. Cook, stirring, until heated through, 
                    1 to 2 minutes more.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour half of pasta mixture into prepared casserole dish. 
                    Sprinkle with 1 cup mozzarella. Top with remaining pasta 
                    mixture. Pour reserved 2 cups sauce over. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cover pan with foil and bake until hot and bubbling around 
                    the edges, about 20 minutes. Remove foil, top with 
                    remaining 2 cups mozzarella, then pepperoni, and continue 
                    to bake until cheese is melted and pepperoni is browned, 
                    15 to 20 minutes more. Once done, top with Parmesan 
                    (if you so desire), and get to serving.
