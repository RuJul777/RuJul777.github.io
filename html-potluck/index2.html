            <br>
            <br>
            It was a cold Halloween night in 1963 when six-year-old Michael 
            Audrey Myers brutally murdered his 17-year-old sister, Judith 
            Margaret Myers. He was sentenced to the Smith's Grove-Warren 
            County Sanitarium for his brutal crime. There, he remained 
            locked away and dormant for 15 years. But on October 30, 1978, 
            things are about to change. While being transferred for a court 
            date, 21-year-old Michael Myers escapes. He returns to his quiet 
            hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois, where he follows three young 
            women.
            Seventeen-year-old Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a quiet 
            bookworm, preferring babysitting over parties. As she goes about 
            her school day, she finds her mind playing tricks on her. 
            Her friends, Annie and Lynda, are busy thinking about the 
            fun of Halloween night. That evening, Laurie and Annie are 
            babysitting across the street from each other. Laurie has to 
            keep an eye on comic-loving Tommy Doyle, while Annie watches 
            "little Lindsey Wallace," obsessed with the television. Little 
            do they know, Michael Myers has come home to kill.
            Their only hope is Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence), 
            Michael's childhood psychiatrist who has followed Michael's 
            trail back to Haddonfield. Loomis enlists the help of town sheriff 
            Leigh Brackett, who happens to be Annie's father. The duo search 
            the streets, but the bogeyman is close to his prize for the night.
