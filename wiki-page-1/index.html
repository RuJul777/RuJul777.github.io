        <p><b>Crown shyness </b>
            <i>(also canopy disengagement,[1] canopy shyness,
            [2] </i> or <i>inter-crown spacing[3]) </i>is a phenomenon 
            observed in some tree species, in which the crowns 
            of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming
             a canopy with channel-like gaps.[4][5] The phenomenon 
             is most prevalent among trees of the same species, but
              also occurs between trees of different species.[6][7] 
              There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is 
              an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it might 
              inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.[8]</p>
